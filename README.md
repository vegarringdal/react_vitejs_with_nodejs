# react template

Trying out simple backend/frontend project template

Trying out npm workspaces in hope it might help a little..


* `npm install` to install all dependencies
* `npm start` to start dev mode
* `npm run build` to build production
* `npm run serve` to run production
* `npm run prettier` to run prettier on all ts and json files
* `npm run eslint` to run on backend and frontend
